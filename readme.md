I designed and created this web application for managing movie-related content as part of my Web Development course at CareerFoundry, with the guidance of a tutor and mentor. The website offers the following functionalities:

- User registration, profile data modification, and account deletion
- Movie search by title using the search form
- Addition and removal of movies from a user's favorite list
- Access to detailed information about each movie, including genre, director, and description

Technologies utilized in the development include:

React.js
React Bootstrap
MongoDB
Node.js
Express
